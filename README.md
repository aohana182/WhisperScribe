# Whisper Local Tool

> I took [QuentinFuxa's WhisperLiveKit](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit) and vibe coded a Chrome extension on top of it. I don't fully understand the internals. If something breaks in the backend, go read his repo — that's the actual engine. What I built is the recorder extension that sits on top of it.

---

## What it does

One-click Chrome extension for recording browser meetings locally.

- Click the extension icon on any meeting tab
- It captures **tab audio + your mic** simultaneously
- Transcribes in real time using Whisper running on your machine
- When you stop, saves a `.txt` file to `C:\MeetingTranscripts\YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm_<title>.txt`
- Nothing leaves your machine. No cloud. No subscriptions.

Tested on: Google Meet, Zoom Web, Yandex Telemost.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11–3.13
- Chrome (or any Chromium browser)
- ~1GB disk space for the Whisper `base` model (auto-downloaded on first run)

---

## Installation (one-time setup)

### Step 1 — Install the Python backend

```powershell
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2 — Load the extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome → go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle **Developer mode** on (top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `recorder-extension/` folder from this repo
5. The extension appears as **"WhisperLiveKit Recorder"**
6. **Copy the extension ID** — the 32-character string shown under the name

### Step 3 — Register the native host (one-time)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File native_host\setup.ps1
```

When prompted, paste the extension ID from Step 2.

This script:
- Finds your Python and `wlk` executable automatically
- Registers the native host with Chrome (writes one Windows registry key)
- Creates `C:\MeetingTranscripts\` if it doesn't exist

**Re-run this script if you ever reinstall the extension** (Chrome gives it a new ID).

## How to use it

1. Open Chrome, go to your meeting tab (Meet, Zoom, Telemost, etc.)
2. Click the **Whisper Local Tool** icon in the Chrome toolbar
   - If you don't see it: click the puzzle piece 🧩 icon → pin it
3. A recorder window opens. Status shows **"Loading model..."**
4. Wait ~8 seconds on first run (Whisper loads). After that it's instant.
5. Status changes to **"Ready"** → click **Start Recording**
6. Talk. The transcript appears in real time.
7. Click **Stop Recording** when done
8. Find your file in `C:\MeetingTranscripts\`

### Buttons

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| Start Recording | Begins capturing tab audio + mic and transcribing |
| Stop Recording | Stops capture, saves transcript to disk |
| Kill Server | Shuts down the Whisper server (frees memory) |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Recorder window opens but stays "Loading model..." forever | Open PowerShell, run `wlk --model base` manually to see the error |
| "Native Messaging failed" in the recorder window | Re-run `native_host\setup.ps1` — the extension ID may have changed |
| No extension icon visible | Click the 🧩 puzzle piece in Chrome toolbar → pin Whisper Local Tool |
| `setup.ps1` says "wlk.exe not found" | Make sure you ran `pip install -e .` in the repo first |
| Tab audio not captured | Chrome requires the tab to be playing audio when you click the icon |
